 # XXX: This should be in packages-openshift.yaml only. For now,
 # it's in the base until the equivalent functionality lands in RHEL:
 # https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-82921
 # XXX: commented out in RHEL10.1 because the rhel-10.1-early-kernel
 # repo doesn't exist yet. In 9.6 this is provided by the rhel-9.6-early-kernel
 # yum repo.
